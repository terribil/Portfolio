This folder contains my project work analyzing the global terrorism database (http://start.umd.edu/gtd/).

I analyzed the data with the goals of
1) Exploring and understanding the data
2) Imputing missing values from 1993
3) Using Bayesian techniques to draw conclusions about whether there are differences in the data before and after the Guatemalan peace accords.
