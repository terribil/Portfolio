This folder contains project work I did as part of a team to analyze the spread of
West Nile Virus in Chicago.   

Our team won the prize for the best submission of the 5 teams in the class.  We were recognized for
having both the best Kaggle score and the best approach to analyzing the situation and reporting
our results to stakeholders.

Most of the code shown is mine.   This work was combined with work of others to create the final Kaggle submission and presentation.
